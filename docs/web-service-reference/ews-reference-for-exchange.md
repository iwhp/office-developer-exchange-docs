# EWS reference for Exchange

Find reference information for the EWS XML elements and WSDL operations in Exchange.
  
This section includes reference information for the EWS XML elements that are sent between the client and server. The XML element reference contains summaries of what the elements represent and information about the potential hierarchies that include the element. This documentation covers the XML instances that are sent between the client and server. The schema that describes these elements can be found in the virtual directory of the server that hosts EWS. 
  
The WSDL operation content in this section provides overview information and request and response examples for all EWS operations, as well as information about SOAP headers and associated error messages for some operations. You can use the version information to determine which features are available in different versions of EWS. The operation reference information will help you to understand the structure of the XML that is included in the SOAP messages that are sent to and from the server.
